One of the best things about being in Central Iowa is that we're surrounded by theatre. For students who truly want to explore theatre as a career or passion into adulthood, that means many audition and performance opportunities for Valley Drama students.

Many of these venues also offer classes and workshops so you can hone your craft.

Here are just a few that you should check out. Click on the links to see their audition schedules/information.
