We simply could not put on a show without the many helping hands of the Valley parents, guardians, families and friends.  We're honored that so many people care about Valley drama and the amazing students that participate.

If you'd like to be a part of our Valley Drama family and give us a helping hand...we'd be so grateful.

We need parents to:

* Coordinate student meals
* Donate food for the student meals
* Solicit items for the Rah Rah bags
* Coordinate food for the Rah Rah party
* Bring food for the Rah Rah party
* Sell tickets at the performances
* Sell flowers at the performances
* Sell snacks at the performances
* Bring food to sell at the performances
* Usher
* Chaperone the Happy Joe's party (Saturday night of the performance)
* Donate money (recognition in the play's program)

And so much more!

If you're interested in helping with any of these, please contact [Linda Crose](mailto:CroseL@wdmcs.org) by e-mail.
